# MCP Sequential Thinking

## Basic Information
- **Project URL**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/HEAD/src/sequentialthinking
- **Developer/Organization**: Model Context Protocol
- **License**: MIT

## Project Description
An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process. This server enables LLMs to break down complex problems into sequential steps, analyze each step thoroughly, and build upon previous reasoning to reach comprehensive solutions.

## Dify Integration
This MCP server integrates with Dify through the Model Context Protocol, allowing Dify applications to leverage structured sequential thinking capabilities. It has been tested and confirmed to work with Dify.

## Additional Information
The server provides the following capabilities:
- Break down complex problems into manageable sequential steps
- Maintain context and build upon previous reasoning
- Support for dynamic problem-solving with reflection capabilities
- Enable LLMs to tackle multi-step reasoning tasks more effectively
- Improve the quality and transparency of LLM reasoning processes

This tool is particularly useful for LLM applications that require complex reasoning, such as problem-solving assistants, decision support systems, and educational tools that need to demonstrate step-by-step thinking processes.
